Introducing the "KDM Cim Petro Gas Station", the immediate to the minimally popular "KDM Public Restroom". Someone suggested that I make a gas station as a complementary building to the public restroom building. This is also the reason why I made it ploppable, so that the player can choose where to build it, and to spread out the distribution of gas stations to something more realistic (nobody wants to see a row of growable side-by-side gas stations stretching down a boulevard).

This ploppable building has the same benefits as a park (similar to a restroom). I chose this perk because honestly I think a lot of Cims would be happy being close to a place where they can refuel their cars. I guess I could have made it a ploppable that caters more to tourists, but it's just a gas station. No big deal.

ALSO, as an added bonus, I've created a video of my entire workflow--from start to finish--of building this ploppable. So, if anything, the KDM Gas Station can be viewed as a didactic example, adding to the numerous other great "how to" videos springing forth on the internet as we speak.
